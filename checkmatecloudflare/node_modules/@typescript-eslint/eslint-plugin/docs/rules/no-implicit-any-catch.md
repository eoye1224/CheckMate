:::danger Deprecated

This rule has been deprecated as TypeScript versions >=4 includes a `useUnknownInCatchVariables` compiler option with the same check.
:::
>>>>>>> features/task-display-and-function

TypeScript 4.0 added support for adding an explicit `any` or `unknown` type annotation on a catch clause variable.

By default, TypeScript will type a catch clause variable as `any`, so explicitly annotating it as `unknown` can add a lot of safety to your codebase.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The `noImplicitAny` flag in TypeScript does not cover this for backwards compatibility reasons.

## Rule Details

This rule requires an explicit type to be declared on a catch clause variable.

The following pattern is considered a warning:

  allowExplicitAny: boolean;
};

const defaults = {
  allowExplicitAny: false,
};

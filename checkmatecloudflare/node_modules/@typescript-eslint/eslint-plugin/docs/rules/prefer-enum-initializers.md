# Prefer initializing each enums member value (`prefer-enum-initializers`)

This rule recommends having each `enum`s member value explicitly initialized.

`enum`s are a practical way to organize semantically related constant values. However, by implicitly defining values, `enum`s can lead to unexpected bugs if it's modified without paying attention to the order of its items.

## Rule Details

`enum`s infers sequential numbers automatically when initializers are omitted:

```ts
enum Status {
  Open, // infer 0
  Closed, // infer 1
}
```

If a new member is added to the top of `Status`, both `Open` and `Closed` would have its values altered:

```ts
enum Status {
  Pending, // infer 0
  Open, // infer 1
  Closed, // infer 2
}
```

TypeScript `enum`s are a practical way to organize semantically related constant values.
Members of `enum`s that don't have explicit values are by default given sequentially increasing numbers.

In projects where the value of `enum` members are important, allowing implicit values for enums can cause bugs if `enum`s are modified over time.

This rule recommends having each `enum` member value explicitly initialized.

## When Not To Use It

If you don't care about `enum`s having implicit values you can safely disable this rule.

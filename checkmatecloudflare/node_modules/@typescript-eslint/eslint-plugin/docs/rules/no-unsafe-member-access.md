# Disallows member access on any typed variables (`no-unsafe-member-access`)

Despite your best intentions, the `any` type can sometimes leak into your codebase.
Member access on `any` typed variables is not checked at all by TypeScript, so it creates a potential safety hole, and source of bugs in your codebase.

## Rule Details

This rule disallows member access on any variable that is typed as `any`.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:
=======
---
description: 'Disallow member access on a value with type `any`.'

The `any` type in TypeScript is a dangerous "escape hatch" from the type system.
Using `any` disables many type checking rules and is generally best used only as a last resort or when prototyping code.

Despite your best intentions, the `any` type can sometimes leak into your codebase.
Accessing a member of an `any`-typed value creates a potential type safety hole and source of bugs in your codebase.

This rule disallows member access on any variable that is typed as `any`.

## Examples

### ❌ Incorrect
>>>>>>> features/task-display-and-function

```ts
declare const anyVar: any;
declare const nestedAny: { prop: any };

anyVar.a;
anyVar.a.b;
anyVar['a'];
anyVar['a']['b'];

nestedAny.prop.a;
nestedAny.prop['a'];

const key = 'a';
nestedAny.prop[key];

// Using an any to access a member is unsafe
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr[anyVar];
nestedAny[anyVar];
```

There are two common ways to tell TypeScript that a literal value should be interpreted as its literal type (e.g. `2`) rather than general primitive type (e.g. `number`);

- `as const`: telling TypeScript to infer the literal type automatically
- `as` with the literal type: explicitly telling the literal type to TypeScript

`as const` is generally preferred, as it doesn't require re-typing the literal value.
This rule reports when an `as` with an explicit literal type can be replaced with an `as const`.

# Prefers a non-null assertion over explicit type cast when possible (`non-nullable-type-assertion-style`)

This rule detects when an `as` cast is doing the same job as a `!` would, and suggests fixing the code to be an `!`.

There are two common ways to assert to TypeScript that a value is its type without `null` or `undefined`:

- `!`: Non-null assertion
- `as`: Traditional type assertion with a coincidentally equivalent type

`!` non-null assertions are generally preferred for requiring less code and being harder to fall out of sync as types change.
This rule reports when an `as` cast is doing the same job as a `!` would, and suggests fixing the code to be an `!`.

## When Not To Use It

If you don't mind having unnecessarily verbose type casts, you can avoid this rule.

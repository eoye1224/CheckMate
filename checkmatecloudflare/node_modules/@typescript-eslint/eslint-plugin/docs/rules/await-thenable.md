# Disallows awaiting a value that is not a Thenable (`await-thenable`)

This rule disallows awaiting a value that is not a "Thenable" (an object which has `then` method, such as a Promise).
While it is valid JavaScript to await a non-`Promise`-like value (it will resolve immediately), this pattern is often a programmer error, such as forgetting to add parenthesis to call a function that returns a Promise.

A "Thenable" value is an object which has a `then` method, such as a Promise.
The `await` keyword is generally used to retrieve the result of calling a Thenable's `then` method.

If the `await` keyword is used on a value that is not a Thenable, the value is directly resolved immediately.
While doing so is valid JavaScript, it is often a programmer error, such as forgetting to add parenthesis to call a function that returns a Promise.

```

## When Not To Use It

If you want to allow code to `await` non-Promise values.
This is generally not preferred, but can sometimes be useful for visual consistency.

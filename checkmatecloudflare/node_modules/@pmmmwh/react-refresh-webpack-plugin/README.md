An **EXPERIMENTAL** Webpack plugin to enable "Fast Refresh" (also previously known as _Hot Reloading_) for React components.

## Prerequisites

First and foremost, this plugin is not 100% stable.
We're working towards a stable v1 release, and we've been testing the plugin quite extensively;
but since it is still pretty young, there might still be some unknown edge cases.

There are no breaking changes planned for the v1 release,
but they might still happen if we hit some significant road blockers.

Also, ensure that you are using the minimum supported versions of the plugin's peer dependencies -
older versions unfortunately do not contain code to orchestrate "Fast Refresh",
and thus cannot be made compatible.

| Dependency         | Minimum                                            | Best       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `react`            | `16.9.0`                                           | `16.13.0`+ |
| `react-dom`        | `16.9.0`                                           | `16.13.0`+ |
| `react-reconciler` | `0.22.0`                                           | `0.25.0`+  |
| `webpack`          | `4.0.0` (for `0.3.x`)<br />`4.43.0` (for `0.4.x`+) | `4.43.0`+  |

> You only need `react-dom` if you're rendering to the DOM.

> You only need to check for `react-reconciler` if you use custom reconcilers like `react-three-fiber`.
> You should check their `package.json` to make sure they use a compatible version instead of installing `react-reconciler` yourself.
> If the reconcilers are not compatible, please create an issue at their repository.

## Installation

With all prerequisites met, you can install the plugin with one of the commands below:

> We're hoping to land a v1 release soon - please help us by reporting any issues you've encountered!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you are using at least the minimum supported versions of this plugin's peer dependencies -
older versions unfortunately do not contain code to orchestrate "Fast Refresh",
and thus cannot be made compatible.

We recommend using the following versions:

| Dependency      | Version                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `react`         | `16.13.0`+, `17.x` or `18.x` |
| `react-dom`     | `16.13.0`+, `17.x` or `18.x` |
| `react-refresh` | `0.10.0`+                    |
| `webpack`       | `4.46.0`+ or `5.2.0`+        |

<details>
<summary>Minimum requirements</summary>
<br />

| Dependency      | Version  |
| --------------- | -------- |
| `react`         | `16.9.0` |
| `react-dom`     | `16.9.0` |
| `react-refresh` | `0.10.0` |
| `webpack`       | `4.43.0` |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using custom renderers (e.g. <code>react-three-fiber</code>, <code>react-pdf</code>, <code>ink</code>)</summary>
<br />

To ensure full support of "Fast Refresh" with components rendered by custom renderers,
you should ensure the renderer you're using depends on a recent version of `react-reconciler`.

We recommend version `0.25.0` or above, but any versions above `0.22.0` should work.

If the renderer is not compatible, please file them an issue instead.

</details>

### Installation

With all prerequisites met, you can install this plugin using your package manager of choice:
>>>>>>> features/task-display-and-function

```sh
# if you prefer npm
npm install -D @pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin react-refresh

# if you prefer yarn
yarn add -D @pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin react-refresh

# if you prefer pnpm
pnpm add -D @pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin react-refresh
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
The plugin depends on a package from the React team - `react-refresh`,
so you will have to install and configure it separately as demonstrated in the [Usage](#usage) section, too.

### TypeScript

TypeScript support is available out-of-the-box for those who use `webpack.config.ts` :tada:!

For that you will have to install `type-fest` as a development peer dependency with one of the commands below:
=======
The `react-refresh` package (from the React team) is a required peer dependency of this plugin.
We recommend using version `0.10.0` or above.

<details>
<summary>Support for TypeScript</summary>
<br />

TypeScript support is available out-of-the-box for those who use `webpack.config.ts`.

Our exported types however depends on `type-fest`, so you'll have to add it as a `devDependency`:
>>>>>>> features/task-display-and-function

```sh
# if you prefer npm
npm install -D type-fest

# if you prefer yarn
yarn add -D type-fest

# if you prefer pnpm
pnpm add -D type-fest
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Usage

The most basic setup to enable "Fast Refresh" is to update your `webpack.config.js` (or `.ts`) as follows:

```js
const ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin = require('@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin');
const webpack = require('webpack');
// ... your other imports
=======
> **:memo: Note**:
>
> `type-fest@4.x` only supports Node.js v16 or above,
> `type-fest@3.x` only supports Node.js v14.16 or above,
> and `type-fest@2.x` only supports Node.js v12.20 or above.
> If you're using an older version of Node.js, please install `type-fest@1.x`.

</details>

### Usage

For most setups, we recommend integrating with `babel-loader`.
It covers the most use cases and is officially supported by the React team.

The example below will assume you're using `webpack-dev-server`.

If you haven't done so, set up your development Webpack configuration for Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

```js
const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';

module.exports = {
  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',
  devServer: {
    hot: true,
  },
};
```

<details>
<summary>Using <code>webpack-hot-middleware</code></summary>
<br />

```js
const webpack = require('webpack');
>>>>>>> features/task-display-and-function

const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';

module.exports = {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  // It is suggested to run both `react-refresh/babel` and the plugin in the `development` mode only,
  // even though both of them have optimisations in place to do nothing in the `production` mode.
  // If you would like to override Webpack's defaults for modes, you can also use the `none` mode -
  // you then will need to set `forceEnable: true` in the plugin's options.
  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',
  module: {
    rules: [
      // ... other rules
=======
  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',
  plugins: [isDevelopment && new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()].filter(Boolean),
};
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using <code>webpack-plugin-serve</code></summary>
<br />

```js
const { WebpackPluginServe } = require('webpack-plugin-serve');

const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';

module.exports = {
  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',
  plugins: [isDevelopment && new WebpackPluginServe()].filter(Boolean),
};
```

</details>

Then, add the `react-refresh/babel` plugin to your Babel configuration and this plugin to your Webpack configuration.

```js
const ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin = require('@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin');

const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';

module.exports = {
  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',
  module: {
    rules: [
>>>>>>> features/task-display-and-function
      {
        test: /\.[jt]sx?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
<<<<<<< HEAD
          // ... other loaders
          {
            loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),
            options: {
              // ... other options
              plugins: [
                // ... other plugins
                isDevelopment && require.resolve('react-refresh/babel'),
              ].filter(Boolean),
=======
          {
            loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),
            options: {
              plugins: [isDevelopment && require.resolve('react-refresh/babel')].filter(Boolean),
>>>>>>> features/task-display-and-function
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
<<<<<<< HEAD
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    isDevelopment && new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
    isDevelopment && new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin(),
  ].filter(Boolean),
  // ... other configuration options
};
```

You might want to further tweak the configuration to accommodate your setup:

- `isDevelopment`

  In this example we've shown the simple way of splitting up `development` and `production` builds with the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.
  It will default to `true` (i.e. `development` mode) when `NODE_ENV` is not available from the environment.

  In practice though, you might want to wire this up differently,
  like [using a function config](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-a-function) or using multiple configuration files.

- `webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin`

  If you use `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-plugin-serve`,
  you can set `devServer.hot`/`devServer.hotOnly` and `hmr` to `true` respectively,
  instead of adding the HMR plugin to your plugin list.

> Note: If you are using TypeScript (instead of Babel) as a transpiler, you will still need to use `babel-loader` to process your source code.
> Check out this [sample project](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin/tree/main/examples/typescript-without-babel) on how to set this up.

### Integration Support for Overlay

Officially, `webpack-dev-server`, `webpack-hot-middleware` and `webpack-plugin-serve` are supported out of the box -
you just have to set the [`overlay.sockIntegration`](docs/API.md#sockintegration) option to match what you're using.

For each of the integrations listed above,
you can also take a look at the corresponding [sample projects](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin/tree/main/examples) for a better understanding of how things should be wired up.
=======
  plugins: [isDevelopment && new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin()].filter(Boolean),
};
```

> **:memo: Note**:
>
> Ensure both the Babel transform (`react-refresh/babel`) and this plugin are enabled only in `development` mode!

<details>
<summary>Using <code>ts-loader</code></summary>
<br />

> **:warning: Warning**:
> This is an un-official integration maintained by the community.

Install [`react-refresh-typescript`](https://github.com/Jack-Works/react-refresh-transformer/tree/main/typescript).
Ensure your TypeScript version is at least 4.0.

```sh
# if you prefer npm
npm install -D react-refresh-typescript

# if you prefer yarn
yarn add -D react-refresh-typescript

# if you prefer pnpm
pnpm add -D react-refresh-typescript
```

Then, instead of wiring up `react-refresh/babel` via `babel-loader`,
you can wire-up `react-refresh-typescript` with `ts-loader`:

```js
const ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin = require('@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin');
const ReactRefreshTypeScript = require('react-refresh-typescript');

const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';

module.exports = {
  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.[jt]sx?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: require.resolve('ts-loader'),
            options: {
              getCustomTransformers: () => ({
                before: [isDevelopment && ReactRefreshTypeScript()].filter(Boolean),
              }),
              transpileOnly: isDevelopment,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [isDevelopment && new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin()].filter(Boolean),
};
```

> It is recommended to run `ts-loader` with `transpileOnly` is set to `true`.
> You can use `ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin` as an alternative if you need typechecking during development.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using <code>swc-loader</code></summary>
<br />

> **:warning: Warning**:
> This is an un-official integration maintained by the community.

Ensure your `@swc/core` version is at least `1.2.86`.
It is also recommended to use `swc-loader` version `0.1.13` or above.

Then, instead of wiring up `react-refresh/babel` via `babel-loader`,
you can wire-up `swc-loader` and use the `refresh` transform:

```js
const ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin = require('@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin');

const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';

module.exports = {
  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.[jt]sx?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: require.resolve('swc-loader'),
            options: {
              jsc: {
                transform: {
                  react: {
                    development: isDevelopment,
                    refresh: isDevelopment,
                  },
                },
              },
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [isDevelopment && new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin()].filter(Boolean),
};
```

> Starting from version `0.1.13`, `swc-loader` will set the `development` option based on Webpack's `mode` option.
> `swc` won't enable fast refresh when `development` is `false`.

</details>

please check out [our examples](examples).

### Overlay Integration

This plugin integrates with the most common Webpack HMR solutions to surface errors during development -
in the form of an error overlay.

By default, `webpack-dev-server` is used,
but you can set the [`overlay.sockIntegration`](docs/API.md#sockintegration) option to match what you're using.

The supported versions are as follows:

| Dependency               | Version                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `webpack-dev-server`     | `3.6.0`+ or `4.x` or `5.x` |
| `webpack-hot-middleware` | `2.x`                      |
| `webpack-plugin-serve`   | `0.x` or `1.x`             |
